<h1> Welcome to the Waste Free App Style Guide </h1>
<br> </br>

<p> The aim of this app was to create a sustainable tool that monitors
and reminds the user of when their food is
becoming and eventually is, inedible.
The idea came from visiting my brothers
house, in which I realised that he often forgot
the food in his fridge that would expire and
go to waste; both in consumption and money.
</p>

<br> </br>
<p> Here you will find the style guides of the application, for anyone that wants to know how it was made/styled. Enjoy!</p>
